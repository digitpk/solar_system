<p>This is my second project on Flutter. This app hepls you to keep record of your ToDos. You can create your own category and save todos in then.It also shows how many todos are left in a specific category.</p>
  
<br>
<p>In this project all the data are stored in <b>External Storage Directory</b> of the app in JSON format. I have used all Material Design. Only two packages are used - 1. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider">Path Provider</a> 2. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/provider">Provider</a>. Path Provider package is used to work with the local device storage and Provider package is used to handel State Management.</p>
